            <h3>International Career</h3>
            <p>
                In August 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only eight List A matches under his belt. So, his selection was considered a "surprise call-up". During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the series. On 18 August 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara. However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli achieved his inaugural half century in the ODl format, with a total of fifty-four runs scored.

                Following the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008. Despite limited opportunities, he managed to make an impact in the single innings that he participated in, scoring 49 runs. In October 2008, Kohli participated in a four-day tour match against Australia as part of the Indian Board President's XI team. The match featured a formidable Australian bowling line-up that consisted of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza. Despite this, Kohli displayed his batting prowess by scoring 105 runs in the first innings and an unbeaten 16 runs in the second innings, demonstrating his ability to perform against high-level international competition.

            <h3>Indian Premier league</h3>
            <p>
                Following the Under-19 World Cup, Kohli was bought by the franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for $30,000 on a youth contract. He was the captain of Royal challengers Bangalore for 8 seasons but was futile in winning trophies.
                At the 2016 IPL, the Royal Challengers finished runners-up and Kohli broke the record for most runs in an IPL season, which was previously held by Chris Gayle and Mike Hussey, they both had scored 733 runs, Kohli overtook them by scoring 973 runs in 16 matches at an average of 81.08, winning the Orange Cap as well as Most-valuable Player Award of Vivo IPL 2016. He scored four centuries in the tournament, having never scored one in the Twenty20 format before the start of the season. He also became the first player to reach the 4000-run milestone in the IPL. At the launch event of his biography, Driven: The Virat Kohli Story in New Delhi, in October 2016, Kohli announced that RCB would be the IPL franchise that he would permanently play for. His 113* against Kings XI Punjab was his best knock of the season.

            <h3>Aggression</h3>
            <p>Kohli is known for his aggressive playing style and aggressive leadership as well. This aggression is often seen in his on-field attitude, where he is known to be fiercely competitive, and his animated and passionate reactions to situations on the field. This on-field aggression has also been reflected in his captaincy where he is known to be proactive, taking bold decisions and leading the team from the front, described in the media as "brash" and "arrogant" during his early career. He has got into confrontations with players and umpires on several occasions. While many former cricketers have backed his aggressive attitude. some have criticised it for crossing the line of fair play or for losing his cool. In 2012, Kohli had stated that he tries to limit his aggressive behaviour but "the build-up pressure or the special occasions make it tough to control the aggression." However, Kohli himself has often stated that his
                aggression is a positive thing and that it helps him stay focused and motivated on the field.</p>
            <h3>Philanthropy</h3>
            <p>
                He started a charitable foundation called “Virat Kohli Foundation” in 2013. The organisation aims at helping underprivileged kids and conducts events to raise funds for the charity. According to Kohli, the foundation works with select NGOs to "create awareness, seek support and raise funds for the various causes they endorse and the philanthropic work they engage in." In May 2014, eBay and Save the Children India conducted a charity auction with VKF, with its proceeds benefiting the education and healthcare of underprivileged children. Kohli also envisions in creating a better sports-facilitated future for children.
